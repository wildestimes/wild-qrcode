# Feature: Arch Visualizer

## Description

A tool to visualize architectural diagrams from various sources, bridging the gap between abstract ideas and concrete representations. It will allow for the generation and display of architectural diagrams based on code, configuration, or ADRs.

## Tasks

-   [done] Define input formats for architectural descriptions (e.g., PlantUML, Mermaid, custom DSL).
-   [done] Implement a rendering engine to generate visual diagrams.
-   [done] Integrate with existing ADRs to visualize decisions.
-   [done] Provide interactive capabilities for exploring diagrams.

## User Stories

-   As an architect, I want to automatically generate diagrams from my architectural descriptions so that I can keep documentation in sync with the actual architecture.
-   As a new team member, I want to easily explore the system's architecture through interactive diagrams to quickly onboard and understand the codebase.

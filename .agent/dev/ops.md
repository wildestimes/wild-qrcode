# Agent Development Operations

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for development tasks.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Before beginning any task, ensure you have a clear understanding of the user's request and the desired outcome.
2.  **Consult Documentation:** Review relevant documentation, including feature files, ADRs, and existing code, to gather context.
3.  **Check Current Status:** To get a real-time update on current development efforts, active features, and their progress, you must read the **`.agent/dev/status.md`** file. This will prevent redundant work and ensure your actions are aligned with the team's focus.
4.  **Formulate a Plan:** Based on your understanding, create a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal.
5.  **Execute and Verify:** Carry out the plan, verifying each step to ensure correctness and adherence to project standards.
